'''An integer  is a divisor of an integer  if the remainder of .

Given an integer, for each digit that makes up the integer determine whether it is a divisor. Count the number of divisors occurring within the integer.

Example

Check whether ,  and  are divisors of . All 3 numbers divide evenly into  so return .


Check whether , , and  are divisors of . All 3 numbers divide evenly into  so return .


Check whether  and  are divisors of .  is, but  is not. Return .

Explanation

The number  is broken into two digits,  and . When  is divided by either of those two digits, the remainder is  so they are both divisors.

The number  is broken into four digits, , , , and .  is evenly divisible by its digits , , and , but it is not divisible by  as division by zero is undefined.'''
